🌍 GUVI Project 1 – Global Sales Performance Dashboard
Internship Project | GUVI x HCL | Data Analytics

This project showcases a comprehensive Global Sales Performance Dashboard created during my internship at GUVI – HCL. The dashboard is designed for a multinational retail company to help stakeholders make data-driven business decisions through advanced data visualization and trend analysis.

🎯 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enable stakeholders—such as sales managers, regional heads, and executives—to:

Monitor total sales and profitability

Analyze sales trends across different years and regions

Evaluate Average Order Value (AOV)

Identify top-performing regions and product categories

Detect growth opportunities and underperforming areas

📊 Key Features
The dashboard leverages powerful, interactive visualizations to bring clarity and insight from complex datasets:

🗺️ Map Charts – Geographic comparison of sales and profits across continents and countries

📈 Line Charts – Visualize sales trends over multiple years

📊 Bar & Column Charts – Breakdown of sales by category, region, or year

🥧 Pie Charts – Share of each category or region in overall performance

🎯 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) – Quick-glance metrics for decision-making

🔍 Interactive Filters – Dynamic filtering by year, category, region, etc.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tableau Desktop – For building the interactive dashboard

Microsoft Excel – For data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing

PowerPoint – For project presentation and storytelling

PDF – For static reference of the dashboard

⚙️ How to Run the Project
Option 1: If You Have Tableau Desktop
Download or clone the repository

Unzip the Dataset/Cleaned_Sales_Data.zip

Open GlobalSalesDashboard.twbx using Tableau Desktop

Interact with the dashboard using filters, hover tooltips, and drill-down features

Option 2: If You Don’t Have Tableau
Open the Dashboard_Preview.pdf to view a static version of the dashboard

Check out the Project_Presentation.pptx to understand the logic, process, and design steps

A Tableau Public version will be added soon so anyone can explore it online.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
The original dataset was raw and unstructured. I performed the following operations in Excel:

Removed duplicate entries

Handled null or missing values

Standardized column names and data types

Created calculated fields (e.g., AOV, Year, Profit Margin)

These transformations made the data analysis-ready and compatible with Tableau’s requirements.

📝 Learnings & Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience with data wrangling, visual storytelling, and dashboard design

Understood how to translate business questions into visual insights

Improved proficiency in Tableau, data interpretation, and presentation skills

Learned to communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders

🚀 Future Improvements
Add drill-down capabilities for product-level analysis

Publish a live, shareable dashboard on Tableau Public

Integrate real-time data using Google Sheets API or database connectors

🙌 Acknowledgment
Thanks to GUVI – HCL for providing the opportunity to work on this real-world analytics challenge and enhance my practical data skills.

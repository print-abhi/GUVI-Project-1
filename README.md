üåç GUVI Project 1 ‚Äì Global Sales Performance Dashboard
This Data Analytics project was completed as part of my internship at GUVI ‚Äì HCL.
In this project, I created an interactive Global Sales Dashboard for a multinational retail store that operates on a large scale. The primary objective of this dashboard is to enable stakeholders to gain actionable insights into key metrics such as:

-Total Sales
-Profit
-Average Order Value
-Sales Trends Over Time
-Regional Performance

By analyzing these metrics, decision-makers can identify areas for improvement, track business performance across different continents, and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard uses a variety of visualization techniques, including:
-Map Charts
-Line Charts
-Pie Charts
- Bar Charts
These have been carefully selected to represent data in the most intuitive and insightful manner.

This is the packaged .twbx file containing all visuals and dashboard elements developed during the project.To open and interact with it, Tableau Desktop must be installed on your system.A public version will be added soon for those without Tableau Desktop.

2. Dataset -
The dataset serves as the backbone of this project.Initially, the data was unstructured and messy. I cleaned and transformed it using Excel by: Removing duplicates. Handling null values. Creating calculated columns as per dashboard requirements. The cleaned dataset is provided as a ZIP folder due to its large size.

3. Project Presentation -
A PowerPoint presentation that provides a step-by-step breakdown of the project. Includes annotated screenshots explaining how I developed the dashboard and enhanced my understanding of data analytics.

4. Dashboard Preview (PDF) -
A static PDF version of the final dashboard for reference. Useful if you're unable to open the Tableau file.
